# SeeMenuBar

SeeMenuBar is a dead-simple Mac OS X app that simply has only one menu item, so that you have a lot of space on
your menu bar for all the other programs running in the menu bar. I made this app because I frequently can't see
the right menu bar app I want, because it's hidden by an app with many menus.

This app was made as a learning project with [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com).
